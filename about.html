            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>We are a group of students who created this website as part of our field project to promote awareness
                about local plant life. Our goal is to make it easy for visitors to learn more about the trees and
                plants around them through technology.</p>
            <p>By scanning the QR codes placed in Teli Gali Garden & Park, users can instantly access detailed
                information, photos, and interesting facts about each plant.</p>
            <p>This project combines our interest in nature and web development to encourage more people to appreciate
                and understand the greenery in their surroundings.</p>

                <h3>Project Summary</h3>
                <p>Our project has developed a user-friendly webpage designed to guide users through detailed
                    information about various plant species. The webpage provides essential details in the form of cards
                    that includes plant's image, common name, scientific name, type, height, life span, oxygen level,
                    and a comprehensive description. Additionally, users can access further information through a Google
                    link and explore video perspectives via a YouTube link.</p>

                <h3>Plants Database</h3>
                <p>Our plant database includes a total of 37 flora within Teli Gali, with 37 unique plant species
                    identified. The data, which is 100% primary, has been carefully collected through field research and
                    digitally documented. All plant information — including names, types, and key attributes is stored
                    as text files in the Gist directory on GitHub for transparency and future reference.</p>

                <h3>Team Management</h3>
                <p>Our team consists of dedicated students passionate about environmental education and technology. We
                    work collaboratively to maintain and update the plant database, ensuring accurate and up-to-date
                    information for all users. Each team member brings unique skills in research, web development, and
                    content creation to make this project successful.</p>
